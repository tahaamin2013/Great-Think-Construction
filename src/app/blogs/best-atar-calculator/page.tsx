    <h2 id="how-good-are-atar-calculators-for-nsw-students" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">How Good Are ATAR Calculators for NSW Students?</h2>
    <p>Good ATAR calculators can guess your ATAR closely. Some are only wrong by 1 point. But they must use the latest data from UAC (the group that makes ATARs in NSW). If you give good and real marks, the guess is better.</p>

    <h2 id="what-makes-atar-calculators-more-or-less-correct" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">What Makes ATAR Calculators More or Less Correct?</h2>
    <p>Some things make calculators better:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New data:</strong> Calculators with the newest UAC info work better.</li>
      <li><strong>Good marks:</strong> If you type your real marks, the guess is better.</li>
      <li><strong>Cohort changes:</strong> Each year, the marks of all NSW students change. This also changes the ATAR. If you put fake or too-high marks, the ATAR guess will be too high too.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="why-are-some-calculators-not-so-good" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">Why Are Some Calculators Not So Good?</h2>
    <p>Some calculators are not correct because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They use old data.</li>
      <li>They don’t use NSW info.</li>
      <li>They don’t change the guess for hard subjects like Maths Extension or Physics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Old calculators can be wrong by 3 or more ATAR points.</p>

    <h2 id="which-one-is-the-best" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">Which ATAR Calculators Are Best for NSW?</h2>
    <p>The best ones is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Our ATAR Calculator</strong> – very close guesses, only about 1 point off.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These calculators use real UAC info. They are better than others that use general Australia data.</p>

    <h2 id="can-these-calculators-give-your-real-atar" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">Can These Calculators Give You Your Real ATAR?</h2>
    <p>No, they can’t. Only UAC gives the real ATAR. Calculators only guess. Every year, marks and scaling change a little. Also, schools change marks after moderation. So, calculators are just tools – not 100% correct.</p>

    <h2 id="final-answer-should-you-use-an-atar-calculator" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2rem;">Final Answer: Should You Use an ATAR Calculator?</h2>
    <p>Yes! ATAR calculators are useful. They help you plan and study better. But use one that has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New UAC data</li>
      <li>Realistic mark input</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That way, your ATAR guess will be close to your real one.</p>
